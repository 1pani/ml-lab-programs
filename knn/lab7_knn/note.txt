          Inspect the dataset and drop irrelevant features.
          Observer the class distribution
          Diagnosis is class label

Part-A

          Create training and testing dataset [0.7,0.3]
          Train KNN
         Display the confusion matrix
         Tune the model: find out suitable value of k as-

               Without cross validation
              With 10-f cross validation

          Draw ROC curve for both 4 (i) and 4 (ii)

Part-B

Repeat all steps from part-A after applying scaling (observe various scaling effect)
