Lab Tasks (Regression-1):

Refer attached dataset of drug2.CSV
Observe the dataset and understand it.
Train a linear regression model (A) as (response~dose), i.e. response is dependent and dose is independent variables.
Observe the model statistics (p-value, t-value, std. error, magnitude of coefficient, R2 , adj-R2 , SSE, RMSE, F-value, etc )
Plot the error and see is it Gaussian?
Plot predicted value vs error and see is it in desired form?
Plot predicted value vs actual value and see is it in desired form?
Train another linear regression model (B) as (response~dose+Sex), i.e. response is dependent and dose is independent variables
Observe changes in model statistics (p-value, t-value, std. error, magnitude of coefficient, R2 , adj-R2 , SSE, RMSE, F-value, etc )
Plot the error and see is it Gaussian?
Plot predicted value vs error and see is it in desired form?
Plot predicted value vs actual value and see is it in desired form?

       Observe the model statistics (p-value, t-value, std. error, magnitude of coefficient, R2 , adj-R2 , SSE, RMSE, F-value, etc )
       Plot the error and see is it Gaussian?
       Plot predicted value vs error and see is it in desired form?
       Plot predicted value vs actual value and see is it in desired form?
       Now apply training and testing in real sense, .i.e., divide the dataset training (70%) and testing (30%). Now, observe the testing and training RMSE error etcâ€¦
        Plot the error and see is it Gaussian?
        Plot predicted value vs error and see is it in desired form?
        Plot predicted value vs actual value and see is it in desired form?

 

Lab Task-2

Refer attached dataset of dmf.CSV

DMF describe the amount of dental caries in an individual. DMFT is to numerically

express the caries prevalence and are obtained by calculating the number of

Decayed (D), Missing (M) and Filled (F) teeth. The sum of the three figures forms the DMFT-value. For example: DMFT of 4-3-9=16 means that 4 teeth are decayed, 3 teeth are missing and 9 teeth have fillings. fluoride is accepted

as an effective method to prevent caries
